CONTINUOUS ASSESSMENT 3

MY WEB RESUME

https://alessandra-reis.herokuapp.com/ 

OBJECTIVE:

Create an online version of a curriculum that could be more interactive and easier to use/read.

WIREFRAME:
The link below contains the first wireframe and the colours that were chosen to build the design of the web resume.

I have previously created a design and I took some of the figures and the colours from the same work.
LAYOUT
The idea since the beginning was to have only one page that the user could scroll down to see all the information. Nothing polluted, nice combination of colours and with the link for my Linkedin in case someone desires to obtain more information. The sections were divided by colours to have a better idea of the sections of the pages being changed.
COLOURS
As already mentioned, the colours came from an art that I have done before. The main colour is close to a brown shade and the whole selection brought me an autumn inspiration combined with the flowers and leaves that were inserted there as well.
CONSIDERATIONS:

At the beginning of the project I was struggling to use the Bootstrap’s frames and having some issues. After getting some more instructions with the lecturer of this subject, Erika Volodko I felt much more confident to keep working and could progress more smoothly. From that I could work in a simple way and the doubts I had I could follow her instructions to check on W3Schools website or Bootstrap library to see which codes could help me to get what I wanted.

GDPR:

All the pictures belong to me and the designs were made by myself. 
The icons were taken from https://www.w3schools.com/, except the icon of the page that I have also created.
